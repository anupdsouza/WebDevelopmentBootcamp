### Web Development Bootcamp
---
Learning web development with the udemy web development bootcamp 2023 course by Angela Yu & material will be added here periodically as I follow along. Not guaranteeing that files will be added for all learning sections & challenges or that the code will be exactly as it is in the course. I have made improvements, enhancements in some cases as well as fixed code where the syntax was outdated due to framework upgrades.
